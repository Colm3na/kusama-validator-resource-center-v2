        as to the security of this portal. You acknowledge any information sent
        may be intercepted. PolkaStats does not warrant that the portal or the

        results of operations and business of PolkaStats or any of its
        affiliates and certain plans and objectives of PolkaStats with respect
        to these items. By their nature, projections and forward-looking
        statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events
        and depend on circumstances that will occur in the future. There are a
        number of factors that could cause actual results and developments to
        differ materially from those expressed or implied by these projections

        limited to, levels of business spending in major economies, the levels
        of marketing and promotional expenditures by PolkaStats and its
        competitors, raw materials and employee costs, changes in future
        exchange and interest rates (in particular, changes in the euro and the
        US dollar can materially affect results), changes in tax rates and
        future business combinations, acquisitions or dispositions and the rate
        of technical changes.
