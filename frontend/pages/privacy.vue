        (“PolkaStats”), understands the importance of protecting and
        safeguarding your privacy when you use our web site. This privacy
        statement tells you about the information PolkaStats may collect on this
        web site, how the information is used, and how you can access and
        correct certain information that we may collect.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you as a visitor choose to register or submit information to
        PolkaStats via this web portal (the “Portal”), you agree to the use of
        such data in accordance with this privacy statement. Please note that
        this Portal contains links to other web sites, including, without
        limitation, web sites maintained by PolkaStats, and other affiliated
        entities of PolkaStats. Also note that the PolkaStats may use third
        parties to host all or portions of, or to assist in maintaining, the
        PolkaStats Portals.

      <h4 class="mb-4">1. Collection of Your Personal Information</h4>
      <p>
        You can access many areas of our Portal without submitting any
        personally identifiable information. You may voluntarily choose to
        provide PolkaStats with identifiable personal data by completing forms,
        sending emails, or other means as may be provided from time to time on
        the Portal. The personally identifiable information that we would
        collect from you if you so choose would typically include your name and
        title, e-mail address, mailing address, telephone and fax numbers, and
        information about your company. In addition to information that you
        voluntarily submit, PolkaStats may, at its option, collect additional
        information about you from third party sources. Personal Information
        collected by PolkaStats will be as reasonably necessary to fulfill your
        requests and to provide the most relevant, targeted offers and
        information from PolkaStats and for no other purpose. All such
        information collected shall be referred to herein as “Personal
        Information”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, PolkaStats monitors incoming and outgoing Portal traffic
        data to help diagnose problems with its servers and to administer its
        Portal. PolkaStats also uses this data to assemble broad demographic
        information about its visitors, customers, and partners in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not seek sensitive information (for example, data relating to race
        or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, criminal record, physical or mental
        health or sexual orientation) from Portal visitors. We will, where
        necessary, obtain your explicit consent to collect and use such
        information. The following is a list of examples where you may choose to
        specifically and voluntarily submit Personal Information to PolkaStats
        through this Portal, which PolkaStats may use for each purpose(s) as you
        indicate at the time of your submission:

      <h4 class="mb-4">2. Use of Your Personal Information</h4>
      <p>
        PolkaStats uses Personal Information submitted through the Portal to
        provide a way for customers, partners, customer and partner prospects,
        and other contacts to communicate with our team. PolkaStats collects the
        Personal Information from you in order to establish and maintain
        relationships, and in order to serve you better. When appropriate,
        PolkaStats may also use the Personal Information separately or in
        combination with pre-existing information.
      </p>
      <p>
        By voluntarily submitting your Personal Information, you consent to the
        collection and use of your Personal Information as described in this
        Policy Statement. In some circumstances, PolkaStats may share Personal
        Information that you voluntarily submit with trustworthy business
        partners. We will only use such third party business partners in order
        to deliver services to us or on our behalf, and they are prohibited from
        using that information for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal Information collected on this Portal may be stored and
        processed in Spain, the European Union, the United States, Canada, or
        any other country in which PolkaStats (or its affiliates, subsidiaries,
        and divisions and their respective third party business partners and
        suppliers) maintain facilities. This may include transfer to countries
        without data protection rules similar to those in effect in your country
        of residence. You acknowledge and agree that by providing Personal
        Information to PolkaStats through this Portal, you consent to the
        transmission of such Personal Information over international borders as
        as necessary for processing your requests. Due to the existing legal,
        regulatory, and security environment, PolkaStats may be required, under
        certain circumstances, to disclose aggregate level and/or personally
        identifiable information submitted to PolkaStats through the Portal.
        PolkaStats will use reasonable efforts to limit such disclosures to the
        following circumstances: (i) where PolkaStats believes in good faith
        that it is required to do so in response to a subpoena or other legal
        process; (ii) where reasonably required to do so in order to maintain,
        update or otherwise implement PolkaStats’s data security measures,
        equipment, technical operations and the like; (iii) where reasonably
        necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against persons or
        entities to preserve and/or enforce PolkaStats’s rights, including but
        not limited to enforcing the Terms of Use for this Portal; (iv) protect
        and defend the rights or property of PolkaStats; or (v) in urgent
        circumstances to protect the personal safety of the public or of users
        of the PolkaStats products, services, and the Portal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, PolkaStats may also disclose Personal Information in
        connection with the sale, assignment, or other transfer of the
        PolkaStats business or any part thereof, or as part of a security audit.
      </p>
      <h4 class="mb-4">3. Protection of Your Personal Information</h4>
      <p>
        PolkaStats undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality
        of the Personal Information, preferences and other information it has
        collected through this Portal and will never knowingly allow access to
        this information to anyone outside PolkaStats other than as described
        herein. PolkaStats has made a substantial investment in its server,
        database, backup and firewall technologies to protect the information
        assets of the PolkaStats network, including the confidentiality of
        Personal Information collected through this Portal. These technologies
        are deployed as part of a sophisticated security architecture and
        protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should also do your part in protecting your information. Your
        PolkaStats username and any password (if such is provided or enacted)
        are confidential, and we recommend that you not divulge them to anyone.
        Unfortunately, due to the nature of the Internet as a public
        transmission network, neither PolkaStats’s network nor data transmission
        over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result,
        while we strive to protect Personal Information that is transmitted to
        us by you, PolkaStats cannot ensure or warrant the security of such
        information. Thus, any Personal Information transmitted to us is done so
        at your own risk. Once we receive Personal Information, PolkaStats
        undertakes substantial efforts to protect the confidentiality of this
        information consistent with this Privacy Statement.
